        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <p style="text-align: left;">On the authority of Amirul Mumineen Abu Hafs Umar bin Khattab may Allah be pleased with him who said, I heard the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him say, Verily all actions are judged by its intentions and every man gets what he intends. Those who intend to migrate due to Allah and His Messenger, may peace be upon him, will get reward of migration towards Allah and His Messenger, may peace be upon him, and he whose migration is due to worldy intentions or a woman he wants to marry, will only get what he wants and what he intended, narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
