        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Hadith 1</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <p style="text-align: left;">On the authority of Amirul Mumineen Abu Hafs Umar bin Khattab may Allah be pleased with him who said, I heard the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him say, Verily all actions are judged by its intentions and every man gets what he intends. Those who intend to migrate due to Allah and His Messenger, may peace be upon him, will get reward of migration towards Allah and His Messenger, may peace be upon him, and he whose migration is due to worldy intentions or a woman he wants to marry, will only get what he wants and what he intended, narrated in Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Hadith 2</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <p style="text-align: left;">Also on the authority of Umar may Allah be pleased with him who said When we were sitting down together with the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him suddenly there was a man whose clothes were extremely white, whose hair was extremely black and no indication of travelling in him however none of us recognized him. Then he was sitting close to the Prophet may be peace be upon him rested his knees against the knees of the Prophet may be peace be upon him and put his hands on the thighs of the Prophet may peace be upon him He then asked Muhammad may peace be upon him tell me what is Islam. The Prophet may peace be upon him said Islam is that you testify that there is no one worthy of wroship except Allah who has no partners and to testify that Muhammad peace be upon him is the Messenger of Allah and to perform salah and give zakah and to fast during Ramadhan and to make a pilgrimmage to Makkah once if you are able to. The man said you are right. Umar then said we were astonished the man was the one who asked the question yet he answered it by himself. The man continued asking what is Imaan. The Prophet may peace be upon him said Imaan is that you believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messenger, the last day, and believe in fate whether it is good or bad. The man replied you are correct. The man then said tell me what is Ihsan. The Prophet peace be upon him said Ihsan is that you worship Allah as though you can see Him, and if you cannot see Him know that Allah sees you. The man asked tell me when is the day of judgement? The Prophet peace be upon him said the one who is being asked the question knows no better than the one who asked the question. The man said than tell me its signs. The Prophet peace be upon him said The women slaves will give birth to their master, and you will see people without shoes, who dislike clothing, and the men who guard flock of sheep compete to build something as high as possible. Then the man went off, while I (Umar) kept silent for the next few days. Afterwards the Prophet peace be upon him said Umar do you know who the questioner was last time. Umar said Allah and His Messenger peace be upon him know more. The Prophet peace be upon him said Verily he is Jibril and he came to you all to teach you your religion.</p>
