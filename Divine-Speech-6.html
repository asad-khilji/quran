        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Adal and Kist in Surah Al Hujarat</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Two groups of Muslims are fighting</li>
                <li>A and B are fighting then C should make peace</li>
                <li>If A fights B again then B & C should fight A</li>
                <li>Then when A stops fighting and wants to make peace again</li>
                <li>Then C should make peace between A and B with justice and make sure to not be unfair</li>
                <li>Making peace occured twice in the ayah</li>
                <li>The second time Allah added to make peace with justice and not to be unfair</li>
                <li>First C was neutral but second time C was involved in the fight too</li>
                <li>So Allah highlighted and reminded to make peace with justice and not to be unfair</li>
                <li>Because the second time around C had a tendency of being unfair</li>
                <li>Adl means open and public justice</li>
                <li>Kist means public or private justice</li>
                <li>The court is called adala means it is open and public</li>
                <li>In the first case Allah said do kist but in second case Allah said do adal</li>
           </ul>
