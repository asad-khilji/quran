        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Tying Something Permanently</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
           <li>Pillars holds a bulding up</li>
           <li>The Pillars are held together by tying together with a rope</li>
           <li>This is a strong tying</li>
           <li>They make it super strong so it does not come apart</li>
           <li>Tying your shoes will come off later</li>
           <li>Tying in construction will not come off</li>
           <li>Allah asked quresh have they tied the knot on not accepting Islam</li>
           <li>Are Quresh set in their ways?</li>
           <li>If they tied their rope then Allah tied a knot</li>
           <li>Quresh tying is temporary but Allah's tying is permanent</li>
           <li>Quresh will want to untie the rope later on day of judgment</li>
           <li>Allah decision is final and the rope cannot be undone</li>
           <li>When Quresh tie their rope a verb was used because it is temporary</li>
           <li>When Allah ties His rope a noun is used because it is permanent</li>
        </ul>

           <li>And the poets only the deviators follow them</li>
           <li>Do you not see that in every valley they roam</li>
           <li>The poets were the entertainers of the time</li>
           <li>These poets expierence the degree of love that kills you and it drives you to insanity</li>
           <li>These poets wander from valley to valley like a crazy camel looking for water wandering aimlessly</li>
           <li>To enter a valley you go down</li>
           <li>These poets drop their standards and they are ready to put themselves down and humiilate themselves</li>
           <li>You could go down a valley but you may not be able to get back up</li>
           <li>You are not even sure of the dangers down the valley</li>
           <li>The poets and entertainers seek the attention of the people</li>
           <li>After a while people get bored then the entertainer needs to come up with something new</li>
           <li>Sometimes they even drop their standards and humilate themselves just to get the peoples attention</li>
           <li>The poets are also the philosophers and they live in the world of what if</li>

           <li>First the roof comes apart and falls to the ground</li>
           <li>Then after a while the walls fall onto the roof</li>
